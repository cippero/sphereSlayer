# SphereSlayer

## Project Proposal
SphereSlayer is a 3D game project in Unity/C# that I created to practice different languages and technologies. 

## Game Objectives
The objective of the game is to reach the end of the maze without touching the floor while getting as many points as possible by eliminating/avoiding enemies and picking up boosts.

## Instructions
* Use WASD keys to move around and space to fly. The primary mouse button will shoot a projectile that damages enemies, while the right mouse button will shoot a projectile that implodes, pulling all enemies together. Reloading is done automatically when the player is out of ammo, but they can also use R to manually reload. Use F to teleport forward.
* The player starts at one end of the cave and must make their way to the other end without touching the floor and avoiding enemy spheres.
* Shoot at enemies to gain fuel and health boosts.

## How to Win
Reach the end of the maze alive!

## How to Lose
If the player lands on lava or collides with enemies they will lose health. If the player's health reaches 0 they will lose.

## Technologies and Tools
* Unity
* C#
* MonoDevelop-Unity
* Photoshop
* Autodesk Maya
